				p.large A designer who creates a truly unique identity and applies it practically across a vast digital platform needs creative firepower, seasoned design ability, and eagerness to get their hands dirty in development. I&rsquo;ve worked relentlessly to become that designer.
					

			p.lead But there&rsquo;s a couple important things to understand...
		.point
			h5.lead As you may have noticed...
			h2 Some of my work is a little crazy, but always <em>thoughtfully</em> so.
			p There&rsquo;s a time and place for everything. I understand where a more creative, even &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; approach has the potential to achieve project goals in a way nothing else could. I also understand where it&rsquo;s a completely pointless waste of time while something much more simple would&rsquo;ve done just as well.
			p So no, I don&rsquo;t try to do something completely outside of what people are used to with every project, in fact I still enjoy design that needs a more practical focus, and I intend to continue doing that type of work as well.
			p I will admit however, I certainly have a history of intentionally seeking out projects where that more creative, crazy approach is exactly what&rsquo;s needed. That&rsquo;s just my personal creative drive, it&rsquo;s been a part of me as long as I can remember and it wakes up with me every day.
		.point
			h5.lead Which I can do because...
			h2 While I started as just a designer, now I pretty much do <em>everything.</em>
			p Design was my original passion, I strived to be a designer and nothing more for a very long time. As I gained more experience and felt both the joy and heartbreak that comes with suceeding or failing in the creation of something you&rsquo;ve poured your heart into, I cared less about being &lsquo;a designer&rsquo;, and more about being <em>whatever it took to actually create the things I aspired to.</em>
			p With that mindset, I&rsquo;ve expanded my skillset far beyond I&rsquo;d ever thought I even wanted to. Most importantly I&rsquo;ve gradually honed sharp front-end development skills, without which my efforts to push design boundaries would end in miserable failure. These also contribute more than I can express to my abilities in branding, animation, and more.
			p I&rsquo;ve done it all and I do it all, because I see myself simply as <em>someone who creates things.</em> It doesn&rsquo;t mean I need to take over <em>every role</em> in a project, just that I&rsquo;ve done so before and I understand the complete process, allowing me to work with teams even more effectively.
		.point
			h5.lead But the funny thing is that...
			h2 After working with every process there is, I <em>no longer really have one.</em>
			p At this point I&rsquo;ve worked with just about every type of design process there is to see in this field. I&rsquo;ve worked with multiple acclaimed digital agencies, multiple small botique studios, a ridiculous amount of startups both large and small, and of course I&rsquo;ve done a ton of solo freelance work with unlimited variety.
			p I&rsquo;ve learned so much from everything that it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve felt like I needed to fall back on a particular process or strategy for a project. I approach every project within itself, and dynamically adjust how I approach every step based on the situation. I&rsquo;ve found that this flexibility allows for greater results than a rigid process.
			p.lead With that being said, on a more personal note...
