				p.large Identity is a powerful thing. A distinct, authentic personality that flows out of even the tiniest details of a product is what brings it to life and makes people believe in it. A &ldquo;clean, usable interface&rdquo; is only the bare minimum of what a designer can do.
				p.large A designer who creates a truly unique identity and applies it practically across a vast digital platform needs creative firepower, seasoned design ability, and eagerness to get their hands dirty in development. I&rsquo;ve worked relentlessly to become that designer.
			p.lead But there&rsquo;s a couple important things to understand...
		.point
			h5.lead As you may have noticed...
			h2 Some of my work is a little crazy, but always <em>thoughtfully</em> so.
			p There&rsquo;s a time and place for everything. I understand where a more creative, even &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; approach has the potential to achieve project goals in a way nothing else could. I also understand where it&rsquo;s a completely pointless waste of time while something much more simple would&rsquo;ve done just as well.
			p So no, I don&rsquo;t try to do something completely outside of what people are used to with every project, in fact I still enjoy design that needs a more practical focus, and I intend to continue doing that type of work as well.
			p I will admit however, I certainly have a history of intentionally seeking out projects where that more creative, crazy approach is exactly what&rsquo;s needed. That&rsquo;s just my personal creative drive, it&rsquo;s been a part of me as long as I can remember and it wakes up with me every day.
