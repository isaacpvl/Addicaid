p This startup provides a platform to design and order pretty much anything you wear, as well as sell your designs to others, crowdfunding campaign style. With things like teespring already growing at the time, <em>our approach was a fantastic brand and infinitely more fun product.</em>
p By pretty much everything, I mean I did the entire brand, app architecture, UI/visual design, and even built the front-end. It was the most unicorn I&rsquo;ll want to be ever again. I came on at the very beginning, and phased myself out after we first launched the full product.

p The &lsquo;Designer&rsquo; is really the centerpiece of the entire platform, and definitely the most challenging and fun from a design perspective. I looked at the competition and felt underwhelmed, so the layout, flow, and almost all the interactions and features of the designer are completely original (and ended up testing quite nicely btw.) I wanted to do the in-browser designer better than anyone else had before.

All the details feeling not just pleasant, but more importantly deliberate, drove users&rsquo; overall perception of ThreadMeUp as the place to go for custom apparel.

p Their primary goal with the site was to tell their story and express the truly weird but passionate culture they have, they just had no idea how. That&rsquo;s where I came in, working closely with them and leading the design from first concepts to the full launched site.

With the help of M3&rsquo;s developers (who built the site,) I was able to work directly in the front-end in order to get the details of these animation sequences right, and balance the pacing of the story as I saw fit.

p Vouch is a cool little startup that&rsquo;s already built out a platform where users can monetize their social following/influence by vouching for products they love. Everytime someone is referred to one of numerous compatible merchant websites through Vouch and purchases a product, the user who vouched for it earns a cut of the sale.
p Other than the logo icon itself, I established this look and feel for the Vouch brand and platform from scratch, weaving the style deeply into the content and interactions.

p Browsing through and interacting with the various vouched items on the site was a primary focus. We wanted the items on Vouch to feel like they were special, and worth looking through moreso than your average e-commerce site&rsquo;s content.
.visual.single.zoom
.shot
img(src="/_img/recent/vouch-add.gif")
.detail
p I designed the process of adding (vouching for) an item really simple and fun. The layout of the steps to adding an item lead right into the layout of simply viewing an item, creating a nice progression and satisfying completion state where the user finishes looking at their vouched item as anyone else would.
.visual.single.zoom
.shot
img(src="/_img/recent/vouch-quotes.gif")
.detail
p In order to make the items actually feel personally attached to a real person &lsquo;vouching&rsquo; for them, which is what ultimately separates vouch&rsquo;s content from any other site in the ecommerce world, I designed the modules to display snippets of actual user&rsquo;s words along with their profile photo.
.visual.single
.shot
img(src="/_img/recent/vouch-grid.gif")
.detail
p The design of my grid system isn&rsquo;t exactly the most generic, vanilla module scheme out there if you&rsquo;d noticed. Whenever I design something different like this, I make sure I&rsquo;ve actually vetted it out thoroughly in terms of front-end implementation. Even if I&rsquo;m using Photoshop to concept something, I&rsquo;m thinking in CSS. Anyways, I gathered different types of images the platform would pull from merchant sites, and made sure my CSS would fit all sorts of different aspect ratios in perfectly.
p If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing more of the nitty-gritty of my process, you could <a href="http://isaacpvl.com/vouch/grid/" target="_blank">check out one of the little documents</a> I create frequently during projects in order to communicate things to the other people involved.

A lot of people are proud of that sort of thing (and they should be) and would love to share their expertise with others.

p All the videos here are direct screen recordings from the front-end I developed for the site.

For navigation I implemented a nice 3D transition effect between the menu and the page content.

p There&rsquo;s also a big component in the form of an interactive quiz experience. Each question features a different &lsquo;scene&rsquo; setting and content relevant to one of the main 11 issues of corporate justice Americans care about. For example here is the scene and question for the issue of Environmental Impact. One of the more boring ones for sure, but it illustrates the theme of the quiz well.

p The format of the questions was pretty cool, and I designed a custom way of answering them as well as a clear, striking way to visualize the results. First, visitors are asked to guess what the situation of an issue <em><b>currently is,</b></em> then, they&rsquo;re asked to give their opinion of what it <em><b>ideally should be,</b></em> before they&rsquo;re given what the actual reality of the matter is. The way I designed it made each step a reveal, and when you see the final reality, it&rsquo;s in contrast to your previous answers. This works especially well as almost all the results were shocking to people.

p Stump is another startup that needed a lot of help with a big launch of their platform. A great branding designer had already established the logo and colors, and then I took that and designed the actual platform in a way that built the brand out further, and of course made the process of getting started for new users very, very easy.

p Above is screen recording of the live site, featuring the universal navigation menu I designed and built myself.
p Analytics8 was a project that had already been mostly designed, but needed some extra help to really flesh things out and make the experience great. The universal navigation of the site was a complete gap that needed to be filled, so I created a highly custom menu that absolutely oozed the pre-established brand. It was really fun to animate and build out the interaction animations using circles and lines similar to the style of the rest of the site.
